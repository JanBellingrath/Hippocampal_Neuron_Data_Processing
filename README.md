# Hippocampal_Neuron_Data_Processing

Data-Processing pipeline for neuronal time series data.

Extensive adoption, as well as slight modifications, of the data-processing pipeline developed by the Loren Frank Lab:

At the moment, this repository contains:
1. A file adopting (partially modified) functions of the Loren_Frank_Dataprocessing Pipeline for access in JupyterNotebook

The resulting output of the data-processing pipeline is intended for estimating the neuronal branching factor (criticality-analysis; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249447; https://mrestimator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/gettingstarted.html; toolbox developed by Spitzner et. al (2021)).
